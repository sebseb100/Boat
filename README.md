Zero Knowledge University (https://www.harmonyzku.one/) final project (testnet). 

Wamble - ZK Gambling Game 
	The following will outline the basic rules of the game, specifically for the launch on the Harmony testnet. There is a good chance that there will be rule changes made before Mainnet launch beyond just the expected interface and efficiency improvements. The section Mainnet Improvements will go into further detail into what needs to happen in order for the game to be market-ready. 
Rules
The game will be created to fit 5 players per game session (users will have to connect their wallet to the dApp launched on the Harmony Testnet). The 5 players will contribute their wager(testnet tokens) to the betting pot, whoever contributes the most to the pot will be granted an inherent advantage in the game because they get to execute their move first. The turn rotation will be sorted decreasingly from largest to smallest wagers. Users will have the opportunity to raise their wagers in the allotted wagering period if they’re interested in competing for preferential spots in the turn que. Once the pot is secured in the pot address the connected addresses can start to make their moves (send/sign-off on transactions).
The gameboard is a 6 by 6 grid (36 unique locations). Users will begin placing 1 marker per turn on the squares and signing off on these moves with their wallets. The goal is to occupy the most adjacent tiles on the grid without clicking on somebody else’s occupied grid. But the other players' moves are completely hidden so it’s really a psychological “taking a shot in the dark” game. The dApp utilizes zk-Rollups and zkEVMs to verify, and privatize game moves. The move hash (revealing what location they mark) will be sent to a circuit where computation takes place to verify the transaction, decode the move, and determine if the player is still in the game, or will be ejected.
If another user places a marker on a spot that already has an existing marker they lose their entire bet, and be ejected from the game. The game keeps on cycling through players until every player not ejected from the game (by placing their marker on a taken spot) decides to skip their turn (not place a marker). People may decide at a particular point in the game that they don’t need to expand their adjacent square potion on the map because the risk outweighs the gain of staying put. In the end, the user with the most amount of adjacent squares occupied wins the pot, but if the game is tied the pot is split. 
The complex structure that needs to be explored is, if a creation is Zero Knowledge can information be stored? Zero Knowledge Encryption ensures that no data can be accessible to any person, but this doesn’t mean that the data can’t be accessible to off-chain mathematical mechanics like merkle trees. A “witness” , a fancy way of saying user input in ZK, is generated. So every time a user enters input in the proof generation algorithm. There just needs to be an effective system in place to ensure that moves are encrypted, decrypted off-chain and with zero-knowledge of which address put a marker on any spot return the minimum information necessary to say whether or not you’ve been ejected or you’ve stayed safe. Ideally, it would be nice to see the entire board and all the distinguishable set of moves after the game session ends.
Note: Players that play too timidly and place very few (1-3) adjacent markers will very likely not win the game, the game is specifically designed to benefit someone with a gambling persona. 
I’m capitalizing on a combination of fairness and privacy in ZK. In that the users will not have a mechanism of collaborating, members of each game will be totally chosen at random. Also fairness, there won't be (any mechanism to prove and invalid proof). The moves that are made are final and completely private, there won’t be a mechanism for accessing the history of game moves on-chain during the game, the off-chain computation only relays the information of safety/ejection, the display during the game is just a mostly blank grid only containing your marked locations.
 
 
 
UseCases
The game should have only one use case, it isn’t multi-purpose. The game is to be played with the objective of winning money. It’s difficult to answer what is the use case of gambling? Recreation is really the primary answer.
 
Competing Products
There are not any competing products/they’re all competing products. Is there a game that is close to the same rules? No. This game is an original idea. Are there thousands of other wager based games that can be played across various platforms instead of this game? Absolutely. So any other wagering game acts as competition although this wagering game has a unique advantage described in the section below. The only way it could be described in relation to existing games is the reverse of the game battleship, combined with minesweeper, but involves a turn auction, and wagering. The main pitch for this game is that it is ZK and that there is no edge to a particular entity, this is what will be explored further in the section below.
 
Attracting Users + What Problem does this Solve 
The game will be designed to be extremely addictive, especially the mainnet launch which will incorporate sounds and animation. The appeal of the game is that it’s a ZK game, meaning all game moves are made with ZK in mind. This ensures that the game doesn’t involve any casino edge because there is no casino. All users are assured that only the other player's random decision is the only obstacle in their way of winning the game and not some statistical edge. Also, the system is completely trustless and only a ZK proof generated witness will use mathematics to verify game moves off-chain and only send an arbitrary “safe” or “ejected” message (acts as a boolean) to decide whether the user can continue to play. The wagering aspect, wagering mini-auction, privatized game moves, the adrenaline rush of the click that can lose you your whole bet, and the general flow of the game is inherently very exciting.
Online casinos, most of which operate off of the blockchain like Stake.com and other platforms, abstract away all the details from their games that have been created by multiple providers. They claim a particular “edge” to each game but since it’s all digital and there isn’t any accountability structure, it is a 100% trust product. There is already distrust in regular in-person casinos because all games except bakarat(rarely offered have 0.5% - 60% casino edge. This game is similar to one of the few games with no edge (besides the casino fee for cashing out chips) poker, there is a pot, only the other players decisions can allow you to win or lose, but in this game there won’t be a clear cut strategy or edge besides the player having an earlier turn which is why the mini-auction is a very important aspect of the game. 
 
Improvements for Mainnet Launch
Adjustable game size board proportionate with more players. Example 10 players entails 10x10 grid.
Users will be limited to a particular amount of bet raises in the wagering period, inherently creating another strategic game in sacrificing the minimum amount of money to grant you a decently advantageous spot in the queue. 
The creator of the game will be engaging in research with Mathematics professors and others to determine if the game has an edge. Every gambing game has an edge, it's important to make sure that one player can’t define a fool-proof strategy to play the game probabilistically perfectly. Adjustments may need to be made.
Animations and Sounds:
 When the user clicks on a safe spot they will likely hear a ding! The spot on the grid will be highlighted in a looplike manner. 
When the user clicks on an occupied spot there will be an appropriate sound, or even more sad no sound at all. The animation will flash red signaling death and the player will immediately be ejected from the game. What’s even worse is, since the game is ZK the board won’t be revealed so all the player will walk away with in his loss is that he clicked one wrong tile.
Players connected to the dApp will be pooled with other players with similar wager sizes.
